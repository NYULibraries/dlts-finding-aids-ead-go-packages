    <head>Content Description</head>
<p>The Mahmoud Hammad collection consists of exhibition-related materials, press clippings, writings, correspondence, biographical documents, documents generated in the context of work as a teacher and administrator in Damascus, Syria, photographs documenting his life and works, and some sketches and preparatory drawings. It also features materials pertaining to his wife, the late artist Durriya Fakhoury Hammad (1930-2015). The collection offers detailed insight into the terms and conditions of creative practice in Syria in the decades following the country's independence in 1946. Particularly rich are materials related to Hammad's career as an educator with a leading role at the Faculty of Fine Art in Damascus, where he advocated for the rights of artists to engage in formal experimentation, took study trips to assess contemporary trends and best practices, and produced teaching materials having to do with art theory and technique. Also represented are sketches and plans pertaining to Hammad's design work and slides documenting his paintings, medals, and other works of art.
The majority of the materials are in Arabic, although many exhibition materials are bilingual (often Arabic and French). Some material is in Italian, reflecting the fact that Hammad studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti (1953-1957) and subsequently maintained ties to Italian artists and critics.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The collection is arranged in the following series: (I) Exhibition materials, 1950s - 2001; (II) Press clippings; (III) Writings by Hammad (published and unpublished); (IV) Commercial and commissioned design work; (V) Correspondence and personal papers; (VI) Photographic materials; (VII) Other items in the possession of the artist. Those series that contain digital objects accessible online are often subdivided by type or decade, and are then usually arranged in chronological order within subseries.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>These materials are part of the family estate of Mahmoud Hammad (1923-1988) in the custody of Lubna Mahmoud Hammad in Amman. They were assembled by the artist himself during his lifetime and maintained in his home and studio in Damascus, Syria, as records and documents pertaining to his professional life as a painter, a professor and subsequently Dean and higher administrator at the Faculty of Fine Arts (Kulliyat al-Funun) in the University of Damascus, and as a public figure engaged in cultural programs and discussion in Syria. Following the death of Mahmoud Hammad and the relocation of his widow, the artist Durriya [Derrieh] Fakhoury Hammad (1930-2015), to the residence of Lubna Hammad in Amman, the materials were transported over time to Jordan. By 2014, the bulk of the collection had been consolidated in Amman at Lubna's residence with only a very few items such as plaster carvings and molds remaining behind in Syria. Over the past decade, Lubna has worked on organizing and scanning the archive and has built a database cataloging the items. The organization of the materials reflects Lubna's cataloging labor, in which she is guided by her intimate knowledge of her parents' lives and careers as artists.</p><p>The materials were digitized on-site at al Mawrid Arab Center for the Study of Art, NYUAD. The first batch was completed in January 2022 and a sixth was undertaken in July 2023. Further accretions are expected.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Mahmoud Hammad (1923-1988) was a foundational contributor to the formation of modern art institutions in Syria. Trained in both painting and printmaking, he worked across media over the course of his career: as a painter, a printmaker, a medal engraver and a sculptor. He drew the admiration of other Syrian artists for his in-depth knowledge of compositional methods and color properties. His knowledge of technique made him a consummate educator and from 1960 until his death in 1988 he not only taught painting at the Faculty of Fine Arts (Kulliyat al-Funun al-Jamila) in Damascus but also rose to become head of the department, followed by serving as Dean of the school.</p><p>Born in 1923, Hammad completed primary school at the Italian School of Damascus and secondary school at the prestigious Jawdat al Hashemi school. At the age of sixteen, Hammad traveled to Italy for a study trip. Throughout the 1940s he participated in group exhibitions organized by emergent civic organizations, including helping to establish the Studio Veronese in Damascus (est. 1941) and participating in the Association of Syrian Artists, based in the neighborhood of Abu Rummana, in the 1950s. Hammad was an early recipient of a binational fellowship to complete a degree at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome. He studied abroad in Italy from 1953 to 1957, there participating in numerous exhibitions and prize competitions. Upon his return to Syria, he fulfilled his fellowship obligations by teaching art for two years in Daraa, to the south of Damascus (1958–1960). The two years he spent in this rural community are sometimes described as a period of social realism, or as his "Houran period," referring to his interest in depicting the conditions of the agricultural region and its laborers.</p><p>The 1960s were a significant decade for Hammad's career as well as for the development of an arts infrastructure in Syria. Hammad was among the first Syrians hired to teach at the Faculty of Fine Art upon its creation in 1960 and its formalization as a degree-granting faculty in 1962. He helped to recruit an international cohort of artists to teach at the Faculty and advocated in the press for the value of a modern curriculum integrating studies in formal experimentation and abstract composition in addition to academic realist techniques. Over the same decade, his own painting took an abstract turn. He exhibited compositions derived from the formal qualities of Arabic writing in major international exhibitions, including the São Paulo Art Biennial and the Venice Biennale.</p><p>Around 1963, Hammad began to exhibit a type of painting that became his most recognized achievement as an artist: painterly compositions based on the modern, artistic manipulation of the letter forms of the Arabic language (later to be dubbed horoufiyah, or ḥurūfiyya). Because Hammad first exhibited his experiments in this vein in the early 1960s, he predated the pan-regional 1970s florescence of Arab artists seeking to incorporate Arabic writing into fine art compositions. For his work with Arabic writing as a basis for painterly compositions, he is considered a pioneer of not only Syrian modern art but also Arab art in the twentieth century.</p><p>In 1967, he won a grant from UNESCO as a creative artist, and in 1969 was awarded the State Prize for Fine Arts. Along with Professor Abdo Kass-hout, in 1979, he won the competition to design "The Unknown Soldier" monument in Damascus, which was built and completed in 1994. His works are preserved in the National Museum of Damascus, the Ministry of Culture and Foreign Affairs, and in private art collections in Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq, Italy, France, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, Russia, and the United States of America.</p><p>Hammad died in 1988 in Damascus, Syria.</p><p>Lubna Hammad is an architect based in Amman, Jordan. The daughter of the late artist Mahmoud Hammad, she is responsible for the artist's estate, including both his works of art and his archival papers. She maintains the artist website, http://www.mahmoudhammad.com/. In November 2022 she participated in a program at the Abu Dhabi Art Fair organized by al Mawrid Arab Center for the Study of Art, "Saloua Raouda Choucair &amp; Mahmoud Hammad - Preserving a Legacy: Custodians of Arab Art."</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Processed by the team at al Mawrid Arab Center for the Study of Art, 2022–ongoing, including Ibrahim Mohamed Ali, Anneka Lenssen, Dina Taha, Ala Younis, Jonathan Burr, and Jasmine Soliman.
The organization of the materials is based on an initial arrangement created by Lubna Hammad, with some further arrangement by members of al Mawrid where needed.</p><p>Arab Art Archive finding aids are prepared in both English and Arabic. Researchers seeking to confirm the Arabic spelling of an artist's name are encouraged to consult the Arabic finding aid. In the English-language finding aids, transliterations of Arabic names are guided by al Mawrid policy to use the artist's preferred professional spelling whenever possible. Spellings are checked against artist websites or social media presence (when existent) as well as any available government documents such as a passport or ID. In the case when no such primary documents may be found, spellings are checked with Library of Congress Name Authority File; academic sources such as Modern Art in the Arab World: Primary Documents; Getty Vocabularies / Union List of Artist Names; and in some cases Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World. Al Mawrid Arab Center for the Study of Art maintains an internal Name Standardization Reference List with notes about authoritative sources. </p><p>Rather than transliterate Arabic-language titles of documents for the purposes of the English-language finding aid, it was decided for consistency and ease to translate Arabic titles, as well as titles in other languages, into English. Translated titles and phrases are placed inside square brackets.</p>  </processinfo>
